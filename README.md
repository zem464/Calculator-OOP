## About the Project
**RE-CALCULATOR_OOP**

Create a simple calculator using the following:

        1. In a file, create a class for the calculator.
        
        2. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)

        3. The application will ask the user for two numbers

        4. Display the result

        5. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.

        6. If yes, repeat Step 1.

        7. If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 

        8. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.


## About the Program
**STEPS**

1. Create separate python files that will contain the parent class, child class, user interface, interface for 2-inputs, interface for 3-inputs, and the main file that will call the methods from the files created.

**Note: The separate interfaces are optional.

2. Create classes for the operations and interfaces according to your likings of organization.

3. Import the other files on the python file that will contain the procedures for the calculator.

4. Create the objects for the procedure to use the class in accordance to the classes and their functions.

5. Display the greetings of your own. (Optional)

6. Ask for how many integers are to be input.

7. Show the possible operations for the corresponding input and ask for the operation to be used.

8. Use a while loop if there are more use of the calculator.

9. Ask for the integers to be calculated.

10. Check the input for operations and equate it to the equivalent operation with the use of the object and the instances in the class.

11. Print the answer.

## Running the Program

1. Put the number of items to be calculated. In this case, only 2 or 3 items can be processed.

2. Put the number of choices according to the list given.

3. Put the numbers that are to be calculated. Press enter and you will get the answer right away.

4. Put whether you are going to calculate more or not. If there are none put 'n', or else put anything to continue computing.
